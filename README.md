# USUWaterDataChallenge
My submission for the 2018 Water Data Visualization Challenge, hosted by the Civil Engineering Department of Utah State University. 

To create my entry, I utilized a Python library named Dash, by Plotly. Dash is an open-source library that is built to automatically deploy the Python-generated graph into plotly.js, another open-source javascript library that itself is built on top of d3.js and React.js libraries. Dash has dependencies on the Pandas and Numpy python libraries, which I used to help make the graph. 

#Note: Entry will be live on https://damp-ravine-58887.herokuapp.com/ or savagethink.space (depending on when the presentation dates are announced).
